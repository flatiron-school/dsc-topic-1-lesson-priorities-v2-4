# 1st Priority

- The Data Science Process
- Problems Data Science Can Solve
- Data Privacy and Data Ethics
- Setting up a Professional Data Science Environment - Introduction
- Setting up a Professional Data Science Environment - MacOS Installation
- Setting up a Professional Data Science Environment - Windows Installation
- Setting up a Professional Data Science Environment - Configuring Git and Anaconda
> Be sure to have your DS environment set up correctly within the first days of the program.  You may be able to get by without doing so for a little while, but eventually an incorrect setup will amplify into significant headaches.  If you are unable to complete the lessons above (aligned to your specific OS), reach out to your instructor for a trouble shoot.  Your instructor also may dedicate specific time for system setup and trouble shooting. 



# 2nd Priority:
- PEP8
> Although PEP8 guidelines are 2nd Priority, it is important to grow your familiarity with PEP8 throughout the program. Doing so will make your code look nice when you show off in interviews.

# Appendix

Once you have finished reading about data science fundamentals and set up your tools, move on to the Appendix. There you will find a lab and a lesson which walk you through using the terminal to launch a Jupyter Notebook on a local server. You will be able to complete the Jupyter content of Canvas via Illumidesk. However, when you move to projects, you will need to be able to work locally. If you don't get to the appendix material by the end of the day, make a note to review this content before the beginning of a project week.

# Note On Lesson Priorities
The items in the topics are meant to be completed sequentially. Lesson priorities are meant to help you zero in on the most important content if you are short on time. That does not mean the items marked as 2nd Priority are not important to your development as a data scientist. Rather, it means that they do not introduce concepts that are essential to progressing through the Flatiron Data Science program.

You will notice that many labs are marked 2nd Priority. Labs reinforce concepts which are introduced by prior items. If you are short on time, your first priority should be to digest the concept where it has been introduced, then reinforce the concept in the lab when you have time.
